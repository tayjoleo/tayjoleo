# Oh Hello! I'm Taylor.

**Developer | UX-Focused Thinker | Aspiring Team Leader**  
**C++ | Lua (Pico-8) | Web Dev | Databases | UX Design**  
**D&D Fan | Basketball Coach | Musician | Big Brother | Dog Dad**  

These days my focus is on **creativity, problem-solving, and tech**—but honestly, I’ve always been someone who loves **bringing people together,** whether that’s at a bar, on the basketball court, around a D&D table, or in a development team.  

Before stepping into tech, I worked as a **bartender, coach, and educational assistant**—all roles where I got to **lead, teach, and adapt to unpredictable situations.** I bring that same mindset to coding and game development: **understand the problem, listen to the people involved, and create something that works.**

## What I’m Currently Working On

- Experimenting with **UX design and web development** to create intuitive interfaces.  
- Building **small but engaging games**, including a **2D side-scroller in Godot**.  
- **Training my rescue dog, Junebug,** who is adorable but anxious (progress is slow but rewarding!).

## What I’m Learning  
- **Game development in Lua and Pico-8**, focusing on small, polished mechanics.

## Looking to Collaborate On
